About:
This plugin generates a 3D ribbon effect for a given element.

Required CSS:
- The element should have a width defined in some way.
- The element should be positioned relative or absolute.
- The element should have a background-colour declared.

Optional CSS:
- define a shadow on the element to provide depth. 
	The plugin does not add any shadows as to not
	conflict with existing lighting models.

Default Usage:
$('{selector}').ribbon();

Attributes:

darken_by: integer 
This represents a percentage to darken the ribbon fold.

on the given side.
The default for both is true.

triangle_width: integer
This defines the size of the triangle, in pixels.
The default is 15.

direction: string
This describes which direction the ribbon should appear to be 
(with respect to the curled edges).
